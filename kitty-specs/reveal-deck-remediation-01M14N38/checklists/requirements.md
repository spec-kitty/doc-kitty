# Specification Quality Checklist: Reveal-deck remediation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-08-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Requirement types are separated (Functional / Non-Functional / Constraints)
- [x] IDs are unique across FR-###, NFR-###, and C-### entries
- [x] All requirement rows include a non-empty Status value
- [x] Non-functional requirements include measurable thresholds
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Verification approach fixed by Decision Moment `DM-01M14N6A5NPZW8ZYGCT8JVVYWD`: behavior/DOM
  assertions only, no new visual/a11y baselines (C-001).
- Scope confirmed with the user: remediate #12 + #15; #13 (build-time SVG pipeline) is a
  separate future mission (C-002).
- The spec references component names (DeckLayout, `initDiagrams`, `pre.mermaid`) in Key
  Entities as domain anchors for the implementer; requirements themselves stay outcome-focused.
