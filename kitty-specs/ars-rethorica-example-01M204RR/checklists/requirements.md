# Specification Quality Checklist: Example content from ars-rethorica

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-09-08
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) — kept to WHAT/WHY; footnote mechanism noted only in Assumptions
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Requirement types are separated (Functional / Non-Functional / Constraints)
- [x] IDs are unique across FR-###, NFR-###, and C-### entries
- [x] All requirement rows include a non-empty Status value
- [x] Non-functional requirements include measurable thresholds
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria (via user-story scenarios + success criteria)
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Placement, scope (Book I complete), Markua stretch split, and footnote-as-first-class-feature
  were confirmed with the user before authoring (AskUserQuestion + resolved Decision Moment
  DM-01M204SYRWNJMSNADEMP1BY7PZ). No open clarifications remain.
